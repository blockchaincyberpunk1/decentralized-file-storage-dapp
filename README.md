# Decentralized File Storage Smart Contract

## Summary
The Decentralized File Storage smart contract is designed to facilitate decentralized file storage on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to store file metadata including IPFS hashes, file names, file sizes, and owner addresses.

### Features
- **FileStorage.sol**: Contains the main logic for storing and retrieving file metadata.
  - Struct to hold file metadata including IPFS hash, file name, file size, and owner address.
  - Mapping from file ID to file metadata.
  - Functionality to store file metadata and retrieve file information.
  - Event emitted when a file is stored.

### Development Status
The development of the Decentralized File Storage smart contract is still in progress. Additional features, optimizations, and testing are underway.

## Note
This README provides an overview of the Decentralized File Storage smart contract. Further updates and improvements are expected as development continues.
